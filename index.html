<h2>Tower of Babylon Prepares for Ascension</h2>
<p>A modern monument to Astha, humanity's first true step to reaching
   the heavens, prepares to launch into outer space. The tower of Babylon
   represents our collective will to push all things unholy outside of
   our savior's greatest creation. Since the Absolution Accords were signed,
   we have sworn off all foreign aggression, and have refocused our nation's
   priorities to honor our savior's wishes. </br> </br>
   
   The top of the sits at 25 miles above sea level, and is responsible for 
   ejecting an average of 300 million tons of waste a year out into space.
   The tower will soon launch, and orbit around earth, collection various sattelite debris,
   and waste we have sent to space. It will then relaunch all debris as far away
   from this beautiful planet that Astha saved as possible.  </br> </br>

   Some more dangerous sects of the Children of Astha believe this to be
   a dangerous act, removing our most culturally significant monument to Astha.
   Some consider this heresy, and there are already talks of some members of the
   Children of Astha trying to stop this launch. </br> </br>

   Godsent will be overseeing this launch to ensure things so smoothly. We are expecting
   potential earthquakes reaching an 8.2 on the Richter scale. All civillians withing a 20 mile radius of the Tower of Babylon
   have evacuated. </br> </br>

   What will this nation look like without the Tower of Babylon? How did we construct
   such a large building, capable of launching into space? How do we even transport all
   of our waste to Kansas to be launched? Does any of this even make sense?
   Try not to ponder too long on these seditious questions, and have faith that
   Astha will protect us all. </br> </br>

    <h2>Where has Astha Gone?</h2>
    <p>
        It has been 8 months since anyone has reported a confirmed sighting
        of Astha. I pray every night for her return, and her guidance on What
        is to come. The Tower of Babylon is leaving Earth, and she hasn't said
        a word to quell all the unease we are all feeling. Which begs the question:
        Where is She? We all know how vocal she is about the direction our nation
        most move to reach salvation. She's more charismatic than any politician, wiser than
        any sage, and more caring than any humanitarian. She is our safety net.
        No matter what we do, she will be there to assist us. We are the chosen flock,
        we only need her guidance to act in accordance with the lord. Her abscense
        is deafening. It's hard not to second guess every decision that is being made
        by Godsent. I know Astha has a lot of faith in the members of Godsent,
        but I've never been comfortable listening to them. They are just servants
        to a holy word that they can't even comprehend, no better than us. </br> </br>

    <h2>Five Years Since the Absolution Accords were Signed: What have we Learned?</h2>
    <p>
        As of today, it has officially been five years since the Absolution
        Accords were signed. A worldwide standstill has taken place. No soldier
        has boots on foreign ground, no wars have taken place, and we have finally
        reached some form of world peace. </br> </br>

        First, lets remember in vivid detail why the accords were drafted. 5 
        years ago what was formerly known as Palestine was beginning to collapse.
        Massive inflation, an erasure of political agency, and multiple civil rights violations.
        The Massacre at Argyle Springs is pretty bad vibes to mention, but that happened too.
        Israel was finally beginning to fully absorb palestine, and full-scale potentially
        nuclear war was about to begin. </br> </br>
        
        Then Astha came to Jerusalem and said that really smart thing, remember?
        Everyone remembers how Astha single-handedly ended the Isreali-Palestinian conflict in one night.
        The answer seemed so obvious, and the world became a better place because she said that thing.
        Palestine and Israel merged states and joined the U.S. as our 51st official state.
        Foreign Policy experts had struggled on how to end this for decades, but none of them
        ever thought to say that really smart thing Astha said. </br> </br>

        Days after Astha said that thing, she urged most world leaders to sign the Absolution Accords
        by saying another smart thing. And thus we have been at peace for half a decade. </br> </br>

        So what have we learned? </br> </br>

    <h2>Op-Ed: The Heavenly Reporter is Doo-Doo Horseshit</h2>
    <p>
        The Heavenly Reporter exists only for the mentally impaired,
        or those so wrapped in nostalgia for old times that they would
        rather just read about things that have happened that they already know.
        Like seriously, half of these articles are explaining world changing bullshit
        that everyone already knows. Who doesn't know about Astha? Who doesn't know about
        the Tower of Babylon. If you're an amnesiac or have been in coma for the past 5 years,
        then maybe you'll get something out of this shit paper. All this is good for
        is for dumping news that would seem like exposition to an outsider, but basic knowledge to anyone who
        would be reading this paper. It's decent reading material for my two five year old children, and 
        decent enough to wipe my ass with, but that's the best thing I can say about this garbage. </br> </br>

        <b>Editor's Note:</b> At The Heavenly Reporter, we try to give citizens of all voices
        the opportunity to share what they believe. That said, did you have to be such a cunt about
        it? People LIKE nostalgia, people LIKE hearing what they already know. I know you typed this 
        out right after beating it to your Astha body pillow, you fucking loser. Has anyone EVER 
        liked a thing you said? The answer is no. You don't understand what people like and 
        you don't understand why they don't like you. I speak for all of the Heavenly Reporter 
        Editorial Staff* when I say we are going to pull all of our resources into destroying
        your life. First, I'm going to find your wife, and make sweet, sweet love to her.
        I'm going to convince her that you're a bad influence on the kids. I'm working a cushy
        job at the Heavenly Reporter, and make more in a month than you make in 5 years. I'll show
        her the life her and her kids could have, and I'll convince her to divorce you. I'll make sure 
        we win in divorce court, then I'll marryher taking your kids with me. They'll grow estranged, 
        you'll see me teaching your son how to throw a football with a perfect spiral, 
        you'll see me threatening your daughter's prom date to have her home by Midnight. You'll see your kids begin to 
        hate you, never providing for them like I can. I'll fake a tear when your kids actually call me "Dad" 
        for the first time. You will have everything taken from you, and I will gain what little you had in life just 
        to make sure you're miserable. I'll give you some friendly advice before I head to 
        172 Wild Turkey Ctr, Edgefield, South Carolina, 29824 to fuck your wife. Kill yourself and save us 
        both some time. </br> </br>

        *All editors are given the opportunity to have an open dialogue with the citizens.
        Threatening to do things such as: Physical harm, coercion into suicide, assault, doxxing, stealing an Op-Ed writer's children from 
        them by sleeping with their wife, convincing her to leave them, and taking the kids in divorce court are not condoned
        by the Heavenly Reporter. </br> </br>
